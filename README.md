# Noughts and Crosses
A C#.Net Core console-based noughts and crosses game

## Tools and Technologies Used
- C#.Net Core 2.2
- NUnit


## Game Rules
- Crosses always goes first
- Players must make a move during their turn in one of the empty slots
- The game ends as soon as a player either gets three in a row, or or there are no empty slots left.

## In a future iteration of this project, I would...
- Learn how to apply the use of interfaces, since there are classes that depend on concrete classes, which makes the 
code tightly coupled.
- Spend more time working out how to solve the challenge without changing the Main() method: this was one of the 
things I stuggled with the most.
- Make the game more interactive by taking the user's input in Console.ReadLine() statements instead of from arguments 
in the Main() method.
